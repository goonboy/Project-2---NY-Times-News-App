# Project-2---New-York-Times-Instanews-App

This is a one-page, responsive website that allows a user to filter six top news story categories via the New York Times API which dynamically displays the content in a news grid.

HTML, CSS/Sass, and JS/Ajax, were used in this project and was based on a mobile-first approach as well as being optimized for 600 and 1000 px screen widths.
